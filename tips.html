        </div>
        <p class="content">RGU Attend is a student attendence app from Attendr. Simplifying register taking across universities. </p>

        <p>RGU Attend consists of two apps, one for students and one for lecturers.</p>

        <p>Through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), the Student app connects to the Lecturer app to record your attendance in lectures and labs.</p>

        <p>This makes signing into classes easier for students since they don't have to fumble around for a pen and saves time for lecturers who don't have spend time finding the sheet of paper.</p>

        <p>Electronic attendence is also more secure since students can't sign in multiple people (i.e. their friends) so lecturers have piece of mind knowing the register is correct.</p>
