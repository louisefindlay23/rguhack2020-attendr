Attendr (an attendence app for university students) put forth a design and development challenge for the RGUHack2020 hackathon. They wanted an interactive web element to include on their website.

Their existing website contained a slider of screenshots of the mobile app so I decided the interactivity could be improved by creating a mobile web app where users could interact with the app to act as a demo.

Attendr were so impressed with what was accomplished in just 24 hours that we won the Attendr Design challenge and asked to continue development in a freelance capacity.
